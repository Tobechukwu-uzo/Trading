        <h2>LION</h2>
        <p class="Facts">The lion is a large carnivorous mammal of the Felidae family.
            Lion, (Panthera leo), large, powerfully built cat (family Felidae) that is second 
            in size only to the tiger; it is a famous apex predator (meaning without a natural 
            predator or enemy). The proverbial “king of beasts,” the lion has been one of 
            the best-known wild animals since earliest times. Lions are most active at night 
            and live in a variety of habitats but prefer grassland, savanna, dense scrub, and 
            open woodland. Historically, they ranged across much of Europe, Asia, 
            and Africa, but now they are found mainly in parts of Africa south of the Sahara.
            An isolated population of about 650 Asiatic lions constitute a slightly smaller 
            race that lives under strict protection in India’s Gir National Park and Wildlife 
            Sanctuary.
